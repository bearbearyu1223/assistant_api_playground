# Craft Your Own Kitchen Companion: Leveraging OpenAI Assistant, Image Generation, and Text-to-Speech for a Revolutionary Cooking Experience 
 <img src="assets/cropped_image.png"  width="80%" height="20%">  

## TL;DR
 OpenAI unveiled its [Assistant API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) during its very first developer conference-[OpenAI DevDay](https://devday.openai.com/). This marked a significant addition to the suite of tools and models available for building conversational AI, a domain in which I've been actively engaged. 
 
 Although I have used other frameworks, tools and models to build customized Assistant in the past (check out my previous posts  [Food QnA Chatbot : Help Answer Food Related Questions from Your Own Cookbook](https://bearbearyu1223.github.io/chatbot/2023/07/31/food-qna-on-server-llm.html) and [Build On-Device QnA with LangChain and Llama2](https://bearbearyu1223.github.io/chatbot/2023/08/14/food-qna-on-device-llm.html)), intrigued by the new capabilities of the Assistant API, I decided to integrate it into a new project. This sample project is a refreshed demonstration of a simple Cooking Assistant, leveraging not only the Assistant API but also incorporating additional functionalities such as [Text-to-Speech](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech) and [Image Generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images?context=node), showcasing a holistic approach to building conversational AI systems with only a few lines of code.

## The Crafted Product Experience 

1. **Direct Communication**: 
   - Purposefully address user (in this case, it will be "Han") directly in all correspondences, ensuring each interaction is clear and personalized.

2. **Resource Utilization**: 
   - Utilize information solely from user’s provided cookbooks when responding to his/her inquiries, ensuring responses are relevant and accurate.

3. **Requests for Visual Representation**:
   - **Initial Acknowledgment**: When user requests a visual representation of a recipe, promptly reply with: "Absolutely! A delightful visual preview of the recipe is coming up shortly. Please hold on!"
   - **Action Step**: Subsequently, craft a detailed and imaginative textual prompt to aid in visualizing the specified recipe.

4. **Recipe Responses**:
   - **Introduction**: Initiate responses to recipe queries with: "Here's a recipe I discovered!"
   - **Summary Style**: Summarize the recipe succinctly using bullet points for easy comprehension.
   - **Summary Length**: Aim to keep the summary under 150 words to maintain brevity and focus.

5. **Handling Limitations and Concluding Respectfully**:
   - **Addressing Unavailability**: If user’s questions cannot be resolved with the cookbooks at hand, or if an appropriate recipe is not available, inform the user politely about these constraints.
   - **Concluding Interactions**: End conversations with respect and professionalism, ensuring a positive and courteous closure.

## Set Up the Development Environment

The provided sample project on [GitHub](https://github.com/bearbearyu1223/assistant_api_playground) acts as a prototype to illustrate the product experience described previously. Follow these steps to set up your local development environment:

1. **Clone the Sample Project**: Use the following command to clone the project from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bearbearyu1223/assistant_api_playground
```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment**: Navigate to the cloned project directory and create a Python virtual environment named `cooking_assistant` by executing:
```bash
python3 -m venv cooking_assistant
```
3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Activate the newly created virtual environment with:
```bash
source cooking_assistant/bin/activate
```
4. **Install Required Libraries**: Inside the activated virtual environment, install the required libraries using the command:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
5. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the project root directory. Add your OpenAI API key to the file as follows:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<Your API KEY>
```
## Run the Application 
Engage with the project interactively by issuing food preparation and cooking queries. Initiate the application with the following command:
```
python main.py
```
To terminate the program, simply use `Ctrl + C`. Below is an example of a conversation generated by running the application.
